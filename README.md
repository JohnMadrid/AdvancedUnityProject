<h1>MazeWarrior</h1>
<h3> by John Jairo Madrid Carvajal and Yesid Cano Castro </h3>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The aim of this game is to find the way out of a Maze. The player is immersed in a 3D environment. 
Through its journey, the player encounters an Enemy that chases him all over the game. This Enemy spawns over time. </p>

<h3>Lives:</h3>
<p>The player starts with a total of 3 lives which are subtracted by 1</p>

<h3>Weapons  </h3>
<ul> <li> <strong>Projectile:</strong>  The player has an unlimited amount of projectiles that can kill the Enemy </li>
<li><strong>Bomb: </strong> The Bomb can kill several Enemies at once, destroy BoxObstacles, and can also kill the Player herself if this is within its radius.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Components: </h3>
<ul> <li> <strong> Player </strong> </li>
<li>  <strong>Enemy: </strong> This component was developed in Blender. </li>
<li>  <strong>BoxObstacle </strong> </li>
<li><strong>Maze:</strong> This component was enterily developed in Blender.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using Blender was perhaps the most challenging part of this project. After many unsuccessful attempts to export our figures from Blender into Unity, we decided to only use part of 
them in order to reduce the file size and be able to increase Unity performance. As shown in the pictures below:</p>

<p>For more visual information of the process creating our game prototype, refer to the Images folder.</p>
<p>For better communication in the development of our game we used GitKranken which helped us to have updated versions of the project along the process.</p>
