<p>Using Blender was perhaps the most challenging part of this project. After many unsuccessful attempts to export our figures from Blender into Unity, we decided to only use part of 
them in order to reduce the file size and be able to increase Unity performance. As shown in the pictures below:</p>

<p>For better communication in the development of our game we used GitKranken which helped us to have updated versions of the project along the process.</p>
